\usage{
get_network_params(
  dt_pair_energy,
  cutoff,
  id_col,
  g1 = NA,
  g2 = NA,
  interface_only = TRUE,
  weighted = TRUE,
  progress = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt_pair_energy}{A `data.table` containing pairwise interaction data, typically
produced by `compute_pair_energy()`. Must include columns: `resid_i`, `resid_j`, `r_avg`,
and `lj_res`.}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric. Distance cutoff (in Ångström) for considering interactions.
Only pairs with `r_avg < cutoff` are included.}

\item{id_col}{Character string. Name of the column used to group structures (e.g., `"pdb_id"`).}

\item{g1}{Character vector of chain IDs representing group 1. If not provided (default `NA`),
the function will attempt to infer groups automatically, assuming exactly two chains.}

\item{g2}{Character vector of chain IDs representing group 2. If not provided (default `NA`),
the function will attempt to infer groups automatically, assuming exactly two chains.}

\item{interface_only}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default), returns mean centrality metrics
for residues at the interface (i.e., those interacting between g1 and g2).
If `FALSE`, returns centrality metrics for all residues in each structure.}

\item{weighted}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default), edges are weighted by `abs(lj_res)`.
If `FALSE`, the interaction graph is unweighted.}

\item{progress}{Logical. If `TRUE`, displays a simple text-based progress bar.}
}
\value{
A `data.table` or a `list`:
\describe{
  \item{If `interface_only = TRUE`}{
    Returns a `data.table` with one row per structure and mean values of
    network metrics computed over:
    \itemize{
      \item `*_all`: all interface residues (g1 + g2)
      \item `*_g1`: interface residues from group 1
      \item `*_g2`: interface residues from group 2
    }
  }
  \item{If `interface_only = FALSE`}{
    Returns a `list` with two elements:
    \itemize{
      \item `full`: a `data.table` of per-residue network metrics for all structures
      \item `interface`: a `data.table` of mean interface metrics, as described above
    }
  }
}
}
\description{
Constructs residue interaction graphs from a pairwise energy data.table and computes
various graph-based centrality measures for each residue. Optionally, returns
metrics summarized only for residues at the interface between two chain groups.
}
\details{
The function processes each structure (identified by `id_col`) independently.
For each, it builds an interaction graph where nodes are residues and edges represent
non-covalent interactions below the given distance cutoff. Centrality measures
(e.g., strength, closeness, betweenness) are computed using the `igraph` package.

If `interface_only = TRUE`, the function identifies interface residues as those
involved in interactions between chains in `g1` and `g2`, and averages the
network metrics over these residues.

If `g1` and `g2` are not specified, the function will try to infer them from the data,
assuming exactly two unique chain identifiers are present.
