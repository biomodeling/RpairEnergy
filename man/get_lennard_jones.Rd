\title{Compute Lennard-Jones interface energy between two chain groups}
\usage{
get_lennard_jones(dt_pair_energy, cutoff, id_col, g1 = NA, g2 = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt_pair_energy}{A data.table containing pairwise residue energy data,
typically from compute_pair_energy().}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric distance cutoff (Å) to filter interactions (e.g., 8.5).}

\item{id_col}{String. Column name used to group results (e.g., `"pdb_id"`).}

\item{g1}{Character vector of chain IDs for group 1. If `NA`, inferred automatically.}

\item{g2}{Character vector of chain IDs for group 2. If `NA`, inferred automatically.}
}
\value{
A data.table with one row per unique value in `id_col`, containing:
\itemize{
  \item `lj_avg`: Average Lennard-Jones energy at the interface
  \item `lj_interface`: Total Lennard-Jones energy at the interface
  \item `n_interface`: Number of residue-residue interactions at the interface
}
}
\description{
This function computes the average and total Lennard-Jones energy between
two groups of chains (g1 and g2) across residue-residue interactions,
optionally filtered by a distance cutoff.
}
\details{
If both `g1` and `g2` are not provided (i.e., `NA`), the function will attempt
to automatically infer the two groups of chains from the data. This requires
exactly two unique chains to be present in the input, otherwise an error is thrown.

Chains in `g1` and `g2` must be disjoint and present in the input data.
Interactions within the same group are excluded.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# With explicit groups
get_lennard_jones(dt, cutoff = 8.5, id_col = "pdb_id", g1 = c("H", "L"), g2 = c("A"))

# With automatic group detection (only if exactly 2 unique chains)
get_lennard_jones(dt, cutoff = 8.5, id_col = "pdb_id")
}
